explaining my program:
in digraph_functions.cpp, i defined the following functions:
preprocess_text
process_text
digraph_sorter_a
digraph_sorter_r
digraph_sorter_c
sort_descending
queries

these functions do the following:
preprocess_text takes in a string and strips it of any punctuation and returns the lowercase of the string
process_text takes in a file and returns a map of vectors where the keys are the digraphs and the keys are the words where the digraphs appear
the 3 digraph_sorter functions sort the digraphs and print them in the specified order, ascii, reverse ascii, or count (descending) value
sort_descending is a helper function that compares vector sizes and is used in digraph_sorter_c to compare vectors
queries handles all user inputs
